Altered glucose metabolism in cancer cells is a widely accepted central driver of malignancy, enabling tumor cells to meet the high energy demands required for growth and proliferation. Compared to normal differentiated cells, cancer cells dramatically increase glucose uptake and preferentially metabolize pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) to lactate to extract energy instead of feeding it into the TCA cycle. Glutamine metabolism is another pivotal pathway altered in cancer cells. Depending on their oncogenotype and tissue of origin, cancer cells rewire glutamine metabolism in various ways to neutralize excess ROS generated by the TCA cycle, satisfy increased energy demands, and produce building blocks for synthesizing proteins, fatty acids, and nucleic acids. Explore our cancer metabolism poster for a deeper look into how glucose and glutamine are metabolized in cancer cells to allow for the biosynthesis of macromolecules and to meet energy requirements for rapid cell proliferation.",

Similar results are shown in Figure 1, where the oxygen consumption rates (OCRs; mitochondrial respiration) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR; glycolysis) of a range of cancer cell lines are compared under high (25\u2005mM) and low (1\u2005mM) glucose conditions. Under high glucose (25\u2005mM) conditions, cancer cell lines either show the Warburg effect (low OCR and high ECAR), high rates of OCR and low ECAR or something in between high/moderate OCR with high/moderate ECAR.

Genetic suppression of PDKs has been shown to slow cancer cell growth in culture and in tumors [8,9],\u00a0 and we used PDK inhibition to study the metabolic underpinnings of how aerobic glycolysis supports proliferation [10]. We found that endowing cells with various means to regenerate NAD+ independently of LDH restored proliferation rates in cells in which aerobic glycolysis was suppressed, confirming that fermentation supports proliferation by promoting NAD+ regeneration. We wondered whether PDK inhibition could cause the proton gradient to become too large, causing ETC to be thermodynamically \u201cproduct inhibited.\u201d We found that dissipating the proton gradient increased ETC activity, NAD+ regeneration and proliferation, suggesting that ETC was indeed constrained by the proton gradient when aerobic glycolysis was suppressed.

However, recent data have shown that glycolysis inhibition in cancer cells can enhance OXPHOS activity; this seems to indicate that the Warburg effect is not caused by irre-versible damages to OXPHOS [21, 27].

It is likely that the Warburg Effect provides an overall benefit that supports a tumor microenvironment conducive to cancer cell proliferation. We and others have proposed that the Warburg Effect confers direct signaling functions to tumor cells [18, 39, 47-49]. Extensive research on the Warburg Effect and its functions in cancer cells have advanced our understanding of its causes and requirements for tumor cell proliferation [29, 52]. * Both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism are essential for cell proliferation in both past and present conceptions of the Warburg Effect.

We found that endowing cells with various means to regenerate NAD+ independently of LDH restored proliferation rates in cells in which aerobic glycolysis was suppressed, confirming that fermentation supports proliferation by promoting NAD+ regeneration. We wondered whether PDK inhibition could cause the proton gradient to become too large, causing ETC to be thermodynamically \u201cproduct inhibited.\u201d We found that dissipating the proton gradient increased ETC activity, NAD+ regeneration and proliferation, suggesting that ETC was indeed constrained by the proton gradient when aerobic glycolysis was suppressed.

Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. Normal proliferating cells can also undergo cell cycle arrest and reactivate catabolic metabolism when their ability to produce ATP from glucose is compromised (12, 13), and signaling pathways exist to sense energy status.

In pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1, studies have shown that mitochondrial fission (involved in apoptosis, migration, and energy metabolism) is regulated by the HIF/miR-125a/Mfn2 pathways during pancreatic carcinogenesis. Furthermore, miR-125a, which is negatively regulated by HIF-1, promotes cancer cell-mediated mitochondrial death by inducing mitochondrial fission, which leads to the activation of mitochondria-associated apoptotic pathways118.

The hypoxic induction of HIF-1 \u03b1 suppresses cell proliferation: acute HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization at moderate hypoxia (1% O2) results in cell cycle arrest by inhibiting c-Myc transcriptional activity (Koshiji et al., 2004). In contrast, HIF-2\u03b1 induction promotes cell cycle progression by enhancing c-Myc function (Gordan et al., 2007). However, HIF-2\u03b1 forms a complex with Max, causing a dose-dependent stabilization of c-Myc/Max association, and increased c-Myc effects on the cell cycle regulators Cyclin D2, E2F1, p21 and p27 (Gordan et al., 2007). While tumors harboring c-Myc amplification likely exhibit constitutively high c-Myc target gene expression, HIF-1\u03b1 activation should transiently divert substrates away from anabolic synthesis and inhibit c-Myc transcriptional activity only when O2 levels are dangerously low (< 1% O2).",

We demonstrate that transcription of the gene encoding the coactivator PGC-1beta is C-MYC dependent and that loss of PGC-1beta expression is a major factor contributing to reduced respiration in VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cells. * P50 CA 103175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States. * R37 CA 51497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States.",

        "snippet": "In particular, many genes directly regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 were up-regulated in tumorigenic *REDD1\u2212/\u2212* cells compared with matched wild-type cells (Fig. S1*B*). Furthermore, HIF dysregulation induced by REDD1 also occurred in epithelial cells, as *REDD1\u2212/\u2212* primary immortalized murine keratinocytes exhibited up-regulation of endogenous HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 compared with their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1*E*). Surprisingly, however, rapamycin did not affect the relative overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 in the absence of REDD1, even though it suppressed mTORC1 activity and modestly down-regulated HIF-1\u03b1 in both *REDD1\u2212/\u2212* and wild-type cells (Fig. 1*B*). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that REDD1 mediates a negative feedback pathway to HIF-1\u03b1 through regulation of ROS that contributes to tumor suppression in vivo (Fig. 5*E*). Consistent with the view that regulation of ROS by REDD1 is distinct from its ability to inhibit mTORC1 activity, we find that blocking mTORC1 activity has no effect on the relative expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in *REDD1\u2212/\u2212* versus wild-type cells.",

Because glycolysis is universal, whereas **aerobic** (oxygen-requiring) cellular respiration is not, most biologists consider it to be the most fundamental and primitive pathway for making ATP. In glycolysis, glucose (C6) is split into two 3-carbon (C3) pyruvate molecules. How many ATP molecules are made during this stage of cellular respiration? Energy is needed at the start of glycolysis to split the glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules. As glycolysis proceeds, energy is released, and the energy is used to make four molecules of ATP. As a result, there is a net gain of two ATP molecules during glycolysis. * The first stage of cellular respiration is glycolysis. * During glycolysis, one glucose molecule is split into two pyruvate molecules, using 2 ATP while producing 4 ATP and 2 NADH molecules. 9.

Glycolysis produces 2 ATP per glucose molecule, and thus provides a direct means of producing energy in the absence of oxygen. In poorly oxygenated tissue, glycolysis produces 2 ATP by shunting pyruvate away from mitochondria and through the lactate dehydrogenase reaction. In rapidly contracting skeletal muscle cells with energy demand exceeding what can be produced by oxidative phosphorylation alone, anaerobic glycolysis allows for the more rapid production of ATP. If a cell lacks mitochondria, is poorly oxygenated, or energy demand has rapidly increased to exceed the rate at which oxidative phosphorylation can provide sufficient ATP, pyruvate can be converted to lactate by the enzyme\u00a0*lactate dehydrogenase.*\u00a0This step involves the oxidation of NADH to NAD+, allowing glycolysis to continue through the\u00a0*glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase* reaction (step #6, see above).",

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, glycolysis was shown to promote tumor invasion and migration *via* large amounts of substrate production, and glycolytic enzymes and actin association, which ultimately support vigorous tumor cell growth (Yang et al., 2020). IL-33, on the other hand, accelerates Th2-associated cytokine synthesis and upregulates glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) through the IL-33/ST2 pathway to enhance glucose uptake and glycolysis in tumor cells, while promoting growth and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (Wang et al., 2016). More significantly, enhanced glycolysis within tumor cells results in the synthesis of excess lactate which, along with the reduced glucose metabolic environment, sustains the immunosuppressive TME (Ippolito et al., 2019). 10.3390/cancers12092403 [DOI] [PMC free article] [PubMed] [Google Scholar&title=Cancer%20acidity%20and%20hypertonicity%20contribute%20to%20dysfunction%20of%20tumor-associated%20dendritic%20cells:%20Potential%20impact%20on%20antigen%20cross-presentation%20machinery&author=S.%20Burgdorf&author=S.%20Porubsky&author=A.%20Marx&author=Z.%20V.%20Popovic&volume=12&issue=9&publication_year=2020&pages=2403&pmid=32847079&doi=10.3390/cancers12092403&)]. 10.3390/cancers11030317 [DOI] [PMC free article] [PubMed] [Google Scholar&title=Tumor%20energy%20metabolism%20and%20potential%20of%203-bromopyruvate%20as%20an%20inhibitor%20of%20aerobic%20glycolysis:%20Implications%20in%20tumor%20treatment&author=T.%20Fan&author=G.%20Sun&author=X.%20Sun&author=L.%20Zhao&author=R.%20Zhong&volume=11&issue=3&publication_year=2019&pages=317&pmid=30845728&doi=10.3390/cancers11030317&)]. 10.3390/cancers14143331 [DOI] [PMC free article] [PubMed] [Google Scholar&title=The%20role%20of%20metabolic%20plasticity%20of%20tumor-associated%20macrophages%20in%20shaping%20the%20tumor%20microenvironment%20immunity&author=M.%20N.%20Hasan&author=O.%20Capuk&author=S.%20M.%20Patel&author=D.%20Sun&volume=14&issue=14&publication_year=2022&pages=3331&pmid=35884391&doi=10.3390/cancers14143331&)]. 10.3390/cancers13081904 [DOI] [PMC free article] [PubMed] [Google Scholar&title=Hypoxia-Driven%20HIF-1%CE%B1%20activation%20reprograms%20pre-activated%20NK%20cells%20towards%20highly%20potent%20effector%20phenotypes%20via%20ERK/STAT3%20pathways&author=S.%20A.%20Lim&author=Y.%20Moon&author=M.%20H.%20Shin&author=T.%20J.%20Kim&author=S.%20Chae&volume=13&issue=8&publication_year=2021&pages=1904&pmid=33920906&doi=10.3390/cancers13081904&)].",

For example, given the inefficiency of ATP production in the Warburg effect, there are likely differences in the kinetics of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which have led to cancer cells promoting aerobic glycolysis. Similarly, studies of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells showed that the CSC subpopulation was metabolically less active and preferred oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis to fulfill energy requirements [42].

In this study, we isolated PNI-associated cancer-associated fibroblasts (pCAF), which demonstrated a markedly enhanced capacity to promote neural invasion in pancreatic cancer compared with non-PNI\u2013associated CAFs. Single-cell, high-throughput sequencing and metabolomics data showed a significant upregulation of glycolysis in pCAFs, fostering a high-lactate tumor microenvironment conducive to cancer progression. Collectively, our study reveals that pCAFs promote pancreatic cancer PNI by shaping a high-lactate TME, upregulating tumor cell histone H3K18la, and transcriptionally activating the expression of genes associated with neural infiltration (Fig. 8O). This is due to increased acetylation levels of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH in CAFs, boosting glycolysis and lactate secretion, which leads to the lactylation of histone H3K18 on tumor cells; transcriptionally activating *L1CAM* and *SLIT1*; and ultimately promoting PNI. Our research highlights the innovative value of CAF-derived lactate in the TME, promoting PNI in pancreatic cancer through histone H3K18la in tumor cells.",

The results showed that after removal of \u2018cancer cell-CAF\u2019 metabolic coupling, there was no significant difference in the cell invasion ability among the three groups (Fig. 7). Similarly, in co-cultured tumor cells and a CAF model, cancerous fibroblasts were induced and the expression of glycolytic metabolic enzymes was upregulated, resulting in a large number of lactate metabolites; additionally, the expression of the lactic acid transporters MCT1 and MCT4 increased accordingly in fibroblasts (30) Thus, a metabolic coupling mechanism exists between CAFs and cancer cells.

VEGF mRNA levels in neuroblastoma cells cultured in serum-free medium increased after 8 to 16 hours in serum, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), epidermal growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor. Furthermore, we confirmed that HIF-1alpha mediates approximately 40% of the growth factor activity stimulating VEGF protein expression. Topotecan blocked the IGF-I-stimulated increase in HIF-1alpha but not HIF-1beta, and this resulted in a decrease in VEGF in four neuroblastoma cell lines tested. These data indicate that growth factors in an autocrine or paracrine manner play a major role in regulating VEGF levels in neuroblastoma cells and that targeted therapies to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and/or HIF-1alpha have the potential to inhibit VEGF expression and limit neuroblastoma tumor growth.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and its inhibitor topotecan in the pathogenesis of myocarditis. Western blotting was used to evaluate HIF-1\u03b1 expression after LPS challenge. Then, after HIF-1\u03b1 silencing, the contents of inflammatory factors were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Subsequently, HIF-1\u03b1 was overexpressed and topotecan was employed to treat H9c2 cells under LPS exposure condition. Additionally, LPS led to the notably upregulated expression of HIF-1\u03b1. HIF-1\u03b1-knockdown markedly decreased the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 compared with the LPS-induced group. Consistently, HIF-1\u03b1 gain-of-function significantly promoted the production of inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis, which was partially counteracted by topotecan administration. **Conclusion:**  To conclude, these findings demonstrated that HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition by topotecan ameliorates LPS-induced myocarditis in vitro, providing a new approach in the treatment of myocarditis. **Keywords:**  Apoptosis; HIF-1\u03b1; Inflammation; Myocarditis; Topotecan.",

Together, the data of present study provide evidence that topotecan intervention blocks the impact of HIF-1\u03b1-upregulation on the inflammation and apoptosis in LPS-induced H9c2 cells. We demonstrated that HIF-1\u03b1 was overexpressed in H9c2 cell exposed to LPS, and inhibition by topotecan could protect against LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis in H9c2 cells. The present study indicated that topotecan intervention abrogated the impact of HIF-1\u03b1 upregulation on the inflammation and apoptosis in LPS-induced H9c2 cells.

Similarly, in prostate cancer, a circRNA-binding complex with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) upregulates c-Myc mRNA expression and promotes LDHA transcription, thereby inducing docetaxel resistance in cancer cells [12]. Other miRNAs, such as miR-34a, miR-100-5p, and miR-642b-3p, have been identified to inhibit LDHA in tumors, playing important roles in drug resistance across various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer [4, 23\u201333]. Additionally, knockdown of LDHA inhibits the progression of cancer stem cells and drug-resistant tumors driven by mutant K-Ras and/or mutant EGFR signaling pathways, indicating a potential mechanism and an intervention target in cancer drug resistance [50, 57].

Mitochondria, the dynamic double-membraned organelles, exhibit a captivating duality in their roles, orchestrating both glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation with remarkable precision and efficiency. In parallel with glucose metabolism, mitochondria are instrumental in orchestrating the oxidative breakdown of fatty acids, a process known as \u03b2-oxidation. These master regulators sense shifts in cellular energy status and orchestrate a cascade of events that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative capacity, and adaptive responses to metabolic stress. ## Mitochondrial Regulation of Metabolic Processes for Cellular Energy Demand. Mitochondria, the dynamic and intricately structured organelles within eukaryotic cells, play a fundamental role in regulating metabolic processes to fulfill the energy requirements of cells. Mitochondrial regulation of metabolic processes is tightly controlled to match cellular energy demands and prevent energy wastage.

If a cell lacks mitochondria, is poorly oxygenated, or energy demand has rapidly increased to exceed the rate at which oxidative phosphorylation can provide sufficient ATP, pyruvate can be converted to lactate by the enzyme\u00a0*lactate dehydrogenase.*\u00a0This step involves the oxidation of NADH to NAD+, allowing glycolysis to continue through the\u00a0*glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase* reaction (step #6, see above).",

The mitochondrial gene mutations that cause Leigh syndrome impair oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in the *MT-CYB* gene found in mitochondrial DNA can cause mitochondrial complex III deficiency.

However the authors interpret this observation differently and propose that ACLY initially binds citrate and CoA in the ASH domain to synthesize the (3S)-citryl-CoA adduct, followed by a structural rearrangement of the enzyme and a movement of the CoA adduct into the CSH module to carry out the cleavage reaction to form the acetyl-CoA and OAA products in the CSH domain.",

In a more recent study, Ito, Carracedo *et al.*24 characterized the contribution of FAO downstream of PML and PPAR\u03b4 to the maintenance and function of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and potentially to LICs. They showed that PPAR\u03b4 is required for the maintenance of HSCs, a function that is associated with FAO-derived ATP production. Plasticity is key, and FAO might provide some of this plasticity by enabling the production of ATP and NADPH when required, eliminating potentially toxic lipids, inhibiting pro-apoptotic pathways and providing metabolic intermediates for cell growth. However, FAO cannot be perceived as a metabolic pathway that is active independently of the microenvironment of the cancer cell. This study demonstrated for the first time that FAO has a crucial role in the survival of cancer cells under metabolic stress.",

Overview of lipid metabolic reprogramming in colorectal cancer cells. Previous studies have reported that FATPs are upregulated in most cancers, such as breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and CRC (40\u201342), and promote tumor growth and invasion by regulating fatty acid uptake (42). Overall, in colorectal cancer, cancer cells can increase fatty acid uptake by upregulating the expression of FATPs, CD36, and FABPs, thereby maintaining the rapid proliferation and growth of tumors (48). Loss of fatty acid synthase suppresses the Malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer cells by down-regulating energy metabolism and mTOR signaling pathway.

Different markers, such as a-SMA, FAP, PDGFR-\u03b2, periostin, have been used for the detection of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TME consists of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and different cells and micromolecules (tumor cells, immune cells, vasculature and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)) [2,3]. CAFs are fibroblasts with a crucial role in tumor growth and metastasis by interacting with cancer cells via various mechanisms, such as exosomes, production of cytokines or cell-to-cell contact [8]. Tumor-cell-derived Nodal stimulates the transition of normal fibroblasts into CAFs, which function to enhance the tumor growth of CRC cells, both in vitro and in vivo, by activating the TGF-\u03b2/Smad/Snail pathway [14]. The trans-differentiation of those resident fibroblasts into CAFs is induced by the increased TGF-\u03b2 production within the TME, which is triggered by the induction of CRC cell-derived soluble factors [34].

        "snippet": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the tissue of origin, the underlying genetics, and the microenvironment, can all impact cancer cell metabolism, including utilization of glutamine. Matching these expression patterns, most luminal breast cancer cells can be cultured in glutamine-free media, whereas basal cells are highly sensitive to glutamine withdrawal and to inhibition of GLS, both in cell culture and when grown as xenograft tumors *in vivo* [10, 17]. The collective effect of these variables is striking, such that the metabolic phenotypes of cancer cells range from those that are highly dependent on catabolism of exogenous glutamine, to those that accumulate glutamine *via de novo* synthesis and are self-sufficient for glutamine requirements. Collectively, recent findings on the complexities of cancer cell glutamine metabolism *in vivo* and *ex vivo*, far from \u2018completing\u2019 the field, have generated many new questions (see Outstanding Questions), and set the scene for future studies to provide novel and biologically relevant insights.

However, the fact that more than one single amino acid can alter tumor cells\u2019 responses to glutamine starvation or its catabolic inhibition creates a challenge for the efficacy of targeting glutamine metabolism in cancer. Another way to reconcile the diversity of other amino acids to support tumor cell adaptation to compromised glutamine metabolism is to define the most critical limiting metabolite. Since tumor cells can use other amino acids to mitigate the stress caused by glutamine limitation or inhibition of glutamine catabolism, perturbing the acquisition and metabolism of these amino acids should be considered at least as a complementary approach when we target glutamine metabolism in cancer. 5.

Tumor-secreted lactic acid activates CAFs. Several studies have shown that lactate secreted by different cancer cells activates and recruits CAFs. In breast cancer, POU1F1 transcription factor in breast cancer cells enhances LDHA expression and promotes pro-lactate and secretion into the TAM. Given lactate\u2019s dual role in promoting tumorigenesis and CAF activation, MCT inhibitors represent a promising strategy for simultaneously targeting both tumor cells and CAFs. Emerging evidence suggests that combining MCT inhibition with metabolic modulators like metformin can further amplify therapeutic effects [114]. Tumor-derived lactate promotes resistance to bevacizumab treatment by facilitating autophagy enhancer protein RUBCNL expression through histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) in colorectal cancer.

As muscle proteins are catabolized, the amino acid skeletons are used as fuel in the muscle, while the amino groups are transaminated from pyruvate, forming alanine, which is then transported to the liver and kidney cortex to be used in gluconeogenesis (Cahill cycle).",

To maintain growth in these conditions, cancer cells employ a variety of metabolic adaptations, the nature of which is collectively determined by the physiology of their cell of origin, the identity of transforming lesions, and the tissue in which cancer cells reside. Furthermore, select metabolites not only serve as substrates for energy and biomass generation, but can also regulate gene and protein expression and influence the behavior of non-transformed cells in the tumor vicinity. As they grow and metastasize, tumors can also affect and be affected by the nutrient distribution within the body.

        "snippet": "### Metabolic Fate and Integration **Alanine-to-Pyruvate Conversion:** Once internalized by cancer cells, alanine undergoes transamination to pyruvate through specific aminotransferases: - **GPT1**: Cytosolic glutamic-pyruvic transaminase converts alanine to pyruvate in the cytoplasm - **GPT2**: Mitochondrial isoform that PDAC cells selectively express for direct mitochondrial alanine utilization **Mitochondrial Metabolism:** Importantly, alanine-derived pyruvate does not equilibrate with cytosolic pyruvate, providing a direct mitochondrial carbon source without altering the cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox balance. This compartmentalization offers several metabolic advantages: - Maintained cytosolic redox homeostasis - Direct fueling of mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle - Enhanced metabolic flexibility under nutrient stress ### Biosynthetic Contributions **Lipid Synthesis:** Isotope tracing studies reveal that alanine makes substantial contributions to biosynthetic processes. More than 20% of palmitate and 10% of stearate contain alanine-derived carbon, rivaling glucose's contribution to fatty acid synthesis. This demonstrates that alanine functions not merely as alternative fuel but as a primary biosynthetic substrate. **Metabolic Reallocation:** By utilizing alanine for TCA cycle fueling, cancer cells can redirect glucose toward other critical biosynthetic pathways, particularly serine and glycine synthesis for nucleotide production. This metabolic reallocation provides: - Enhanced anabolic capacity - Improved resource utilization efficiency - Better adaptation to nutrient-poor microenvironments ### Metabolic Crisis and Therapeutic Vulnerability **SLC38A2 Dependency:** Loss of SLC38A2 in PDAC cells creates a profound metabolic crisis. Without this transporter, cells cannot effectively concentrate intracellular alanine, leading to: - Increased demand for de novo alanine synthesis - Metabolic shunting of cytosolic pyruvate and nitrogen sources toward mitochondrial alanine biosynthesis - Passive efflux of newly synthesized alanine to the environment This metabolic disruption results in significantly impaired tumor growth, suggesting SLC38A2 as a potential therapeutic target. ### Integration with Broader Cancer Metabolism **Connection to Other Metabolic Pathways:** The alanine metabolism network intersects with multiple other metabolic processes: - **Glutaminolysis**: Glutamine provides nitrogen for alanine synthesis through transamination - **Branched-chain amino acid metabolism**: BCAA catabolism contributes nitrogen sources for alanine biosynthesis - **Glycolysis**: Pyruvate serves as both precursor and product in alanine metabolism **Tumor Microenvironment Context:** This metabolic cross-talk becomes particularly critical in the nutrient-depleted pancreatic tumor microenvironment, characterized by: - Desmoplastic reaction limiting vascularization - Hypoxic and acidic conditions - Limited glucose and glutamine availability Under these conditions, the PSC-cancer cell alanine shuttle provides a metabolic lifeline that supports continued tumor growth and progression. ### Clinical and Therapeutic Implications The understanding of metabolic cross-talk, particularly alanine metabolism, reveals potential therapeutic strategies: - **Transporter targeting**: SLC38A2 inhibition disrupts alanine uptake - **Autophagy modulation**: Preventing PSC autophagy reduces alanine supply - **Aminotransferase inhibition**: Blocking alanine-to-pyruvate conversion - **Combination approaches**: Targeting multiple nodes in the metabolic network simultaneously This metabolic interdependence between cancer and stromal cells represents both a survival mechanism for cancer cells in harsh microenvironments and a potential therapeutic vulnerability that could be exploited for treatment. ## 11.7 Therapeutic Targeting of Cancer Metabolism ### 11.7.1 Targeting Glycolysis In order to disrupt the metabolic bridge in CAF-cancer cell interactions through glycolysis and lactate metabolism inhibition, three potential strategies have been proposed.

By providing lactate and ketone bodies, acidic compounds that can form acetyl-CoA in a reversible manner, and by taking up reactive oxygen species that promote glycolytic metabolic pathways, CAFs establish a fundamental relationship with adjacent cancer cells. CAFs are also involved in the maintenance of an acidic extracellular environment, providing suitable conditions for optimal cancer cell growth. **Mitochondrial Transfer** CAFs can transfer functional mitochondria to prostate cancer cells. Much research has been focused on exosomes secreted by cancer cells, while little is known about exosomes secreted by CAFs. CAF-derived exosomes (CDEs) are taken up by cancer cells in a KRAS-independent mechanism and are, indeed, capable of reprogramming the metabolic activity of pancreatic and prostate cancer cells. They demonstrated how CDE can sustain the rapidly dividing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions or when the normal oxidative mitochondrial function has been disabled. Additionally, the presence of CDEs can rescue prostate and pancreatic cancer cells from starvation by providing de novo-synthesized metabolites, such as amino acids. ### 11.6.3 Alanine Metabolism: A Critical Metabolic Bridge **Fundamental Role in Pancreatic Cancer:** In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer, alanine has emerged as a critical non-essential amino acid that outcompetes glucose and glutamine-derived carbon to fuel the TCA cycle. This metabolic reprogramming allows glucose to enter the serine biosynthetic pathway to generate nucleic acids, further contributing to rapid cancer cell proliferation. **Autophagy-Dependent Alanine Secretion:** Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) - myofibroblast-like cells that comprise the major stromal component in pancreatic tumors - secrete alanine through an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Cancer cells actively stimulate this autophagic process in PSCs, creating a sophisticated metabolic interaction where cancer cells induce their own nutrient supply. Given that alanine is the second most represented amino acid in proteins, autophagic protein catabolism provides an abundant source of free alanine. ### Transporter-Mediated Metabolic Niche Formation **Differential Amino Acid Transporter Expression:** The alanine cross-talk between PSCs and PDAC cells is orchestrated through differential expression of specific membrane transporters: - **SLC1A4 (Alanine-Serine-Cysteine Transporter 1)**: PSCs utilize this sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter to rapidly exchange and maintain environmental alanine concentrations - **SLC38A2 (Sodium-coupled Neutral Amino acid Transporter 2)**: PDAC cells upregulate this transporter to actively uptake alanine from the microenvironment This differential transporter expression creates a highly efficient metabolic niche that facilitates directed nutrient flow from stromal to cancer cells. ### Metabolic Fate and Integration **Alanine-to-Pyruvate Conversion:** Once internalized by cancer cells, alanine undergoes transamination to pyruvate through specific aminotransferases: - **GPT1**: Cytosolic glutamic-pyruvic transaminase converts alanine to pyruvate in the cytoplasm - **GPT2**: Mitochondrial isoform that PDAC cells selectively express for direct mitochondrial alanine utilization **Mitochondrial Metabolism:** Importantly, alanine-derived pyruvate does not equilibrate with cytosolic pyruvate, providing a direct mitochondrial carbon source without altering the cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox balance.

Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body. For decades, there has been growing evidence of a relationship between metabolism and malignant cell proliferation. Unlike normal differentiated cells, cancer cells have reprogrammed metabolism in order to fulfill their energy requirements. These cells display crucial modifications in many metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and glutaminolysis, which include the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the electron transport chain (ETC), and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Cancer cells need not only a genetic switch but also metabolic building blocks and energy sources to undergo rapid proliferation. This metabolic reprogramming represents one of the emerging hallmarks of cancer and provides both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. ## 11.1 The Warburg Effect: Historical Discovery and Modern Understanding ### 11.1.1 Historical Perspective Otto Warburg observed a peculiar phenomenon in 1924, unknowingly laying the foundation for the field of cancer metabolism. While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis, Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose. In 1927, Warburg studied the processes of respiration and fermentation in tumor cells. According to normal cellular respiration, glucose is converted to pyruvate, which then enters the TCA cycle to undergo oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen, and there should be minimal lactate production. However, in his in vivo and ex vivo studies, Warburg observed an increased glucose uptake and increased lactic acid production in tumor cells as compared to normal cells, even in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon, the metabolism of glucose to lactate despite the presence of adequate oxygen, is called the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis. For Warburg, several questions remained unanswered, including why cancer cells would inefficiently shunt glucose-derived pyruvate to lactate production instead of to the TCA cycle, which would result in significantly higher ATP production. ### 11.1.2 Contemporary Understanding **Efficiency and Kinetics** Given the inefficiency of ATP production in the Warburg effect, there are likely differences in the kinetics of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which have led to cancer cells promoting aerobic glycolysis. Demetrios et al. found that, in the Warburg effect, the flux of glucose to lactate is up to 100 times faster than through the TCA cycle resulting in similar amounts of ATP production over the same time. Even when oxidative phosphorylation is actively continuing, aerobic glycolysis will see much higher glucose flux. **Anabolic Requirements** To further understand a cancer cell's dependence on aerobic glycolysis, it is necessary to revisit one of the hallmarks of cancer\u2014rapid proliferation supported by strong anabolism. Tumor cells need not only ATP but also anabolic metabolism to accumulate a large amount of biomass to sustain their growth. **Clinical Applications** PET is",

This compartmentalization offers several metabolic advantages: - Maintained cytosolic redox homeostasis - Direct fueling of mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle - Enhanced metabolic flexibility under nutrient stress ### Biosynthetic Contributions **Lipid Synthesis:** Isotope tracing studies reveal that alanine makes substantial contributions to biosynthetic processes. More than 20% of palmitate and 10% of stearate contain alanine-derived carbon, rivaling glucose's contribution to fatty acid synthesis. This demonstrates that alanine functions not merely as alternative fuel but as a primary biosynthetic substrate. **Metabolic Reallocation:** By utilizing alanine for TCA cycle fueling, cancer cells can redirect glucose toward other critical biosynthetic pathways, particularly serine and glycine synthesis for nucleotide production. This metabolic reallocation provides: - Enhanced anabolic capacity - Improved resource utilization efficiency - Better adaptation to nutrient-poor microenvironments ### Metabolic Crisis and Therapeutic Vulnerability **SLC38A2 Dependency:** Loss of SLC38A2 in PDAC cells creates a profound metabolic crisis. Without this transporter, cells cannot effectively concentrate intracellular alanine, leading to: - Increased demand for de novo alanine synthesis - Metabolic shunting of cytosolic pyruvate and nitrogen sources toward mitochondrial alanine biosynthesis - Passive efflux of newly synthesized alanine to the environment This metabolic disruption results in significantly impaired tumor growth, suggesting SLC38A2 as a potential therapeutic target. ### Integration with Broader Cancer Metabolism **Connection to Other Metabolic Pathways:** The alanine metabolism network intersects with multiple other metabolic processes: - **Glutaminolysis**: Glutamine provides nitrogen for alanine synthesis through transamination - **Branched-chain amino acid metabolism**: BCAA catabolism contributes nitrogen sources for alanine biosynthesis - **Glycolysis**: Pyruvate serves as both precursor and product in alanine metabolism **Tumor Microenvironment Context:** This metabolic cross-talk becomes particularly critical in the nutrient-depleted pancreatic tumor microenvironment, characterized by: - Desmoplastic reaction limiting vascularization - Hypoxic and acidic conditions - Limited glucose and glutamine availability Under these conditions, the PSC-cancer cell alanine shuttle provides a metabolic lifeline that supports continued tumor growth and progression. ### Clinical and Therapeutic Implications The understanding of metabolic cross-talk, particularly alanine metabolism, reveals potential therapeutic strategies: - **Transporter targeting**: SLC38A2 inhibition disrupts alanine uptake - **Autophagy modulation**: Preventing PSC autophagy reduces alanine supply - **Aminotransferase inhibition**: Blocking alanine-to-pyruvate conversion - **Combination approaches**: Targeting multiple nodes in the metabolic network simultaneously This metabolic interdependence between cancer and stromal cells represents both a survival mechanism for cancer cells in harsh microenvironments and a potential therapeutic vulnerability that could be exploited for treatment. ## 11.7 Therapeutic Targeting of Cancer Metabolism ### 11.7.1 Targeting Glycolysis In order to disrupt the metabolic bridge in CAF-cancer cell interactions through glycolysis and lactate metabolism inhibition, three potential strategies have been proposed.

        "snippet": "and utilize as substrates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. By providing lactate and ketone bodies, acidic compounds that can form acetyl-CoA in a reversible manner, and by taking up reactive oxygen species that promote glycolytic metabolic pathways, CAFs establish a fundamental relationship with adjacent cancer cells. CAFs are also involved in the maintenance of an acidic extracellular environment, providing suitable conditions for optimal cancer cell growth. **Mitochondrial Transfer** CAFs can transfer functional mitochondria to prostate cancer cells. Much research has been focused on exosomes secreted by cancer cells, while little is known about exosomes secreted by CAFs. CAF-derived exosomes (CDEs) are taken up by cancer cells in a KRAS-independent mechanism and are, indeed, capable of reprogramming the metabolic activity of pancreatic and prostate cancer cells. They demonstrated how CDE can sustain the rapidly dividing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions or when the normal oxidative mitochondrial function has been disabled. Additionally, the presence of CDEs can rescue prostate and pancreatic cancer cells from starvation by providing de novo-synthesized metabolites, such as amino acids. ### 11.6.3 Alanine Metabolism: A Critical Metabolic Bridge **Fundamental Role in Pancreatic Cancer:** In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer, alanine has emerged as a critical non-essential amino acid that outcompetes glucose and glutamine-derived carbon to fuel the TCA cycle. This metabolic reprogramming allows glucose to enter the serine biosynthetic pathway to generate nucleic acids, further contributing to rapid cancer cell proliferation. **Autophagy-Dependent Alanine Secretion:** Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) - myofibroblast-like cells that comprise the major stromal component in pancreatic tumors - secrete alanine through an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Cancer cells actively stimulate this autophagic process in PSCs, creating a sophisticated metabolic interaction where cancer cells induce their own nutrient supply. Given that alanine is the second most represented amino acid in proteins, autophagic protein catabolism provides an abundant source of free alanine. ### Transporter-Mediated Metabolic Niche Formation **Differential Amino Acid Transporter Expression:** The alanine cross-talk between PSCs and PDAC cells is orchestrated through differential expression of specific membrane transporters: - **SLC1A4 (Alanine-Serine-Cysteine Transporter 1)**: PSCs utilize this sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter to rapidly exchange and maintain environmental alanine concentrations - **SLC38A2 (Sodium-coupled Neutral Amino acid Transporter 2)**: PDAC cells upregulate this transporter to actively uptake alanine from the microenvironment This differential transporter expression creates a highly efficient metabolic niche that facilitates directed nutrient flow from stromal to cancer cells. ### Metabolic Fate and Integration **Alanine-to-Pyruvate Conversion:** Once internalized by cancer cells, alanine undergoes transamination to pyruvate through specific aminotransferases: - **GPT1**: Cytosolic glutamic-pyruvic transaminase converts alanine to pyruvate in the cytoplasm - **GPT2**: Mitochondrial isoform that PDAC cells selectively express for direct mitochondrial alanine utilization **Mitochondrial Metabolism:** Importantly, alanine-derived pyruvate does not equilibrate with cytosolic pyruvate, providing a direct mitochondrial carbon source without altering the cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox balance.

First, elevated expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 in cancer cells is a potential target for blocking cellular uptake of two types of mitochondrial fuels, ketone bodies and lactate. MCT1 and MCT2 inhibitors can block the influx and efflux of lactate produced by either CAFs or cancer cells. Thus, due to the rapid accumulation of lactate and protons within cancer cells by inhibiting lactate influx/efflux, rapid acidification can occur in cancer cells and the TME, resulting in lactic acidosis. For instance, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (ACCA), an MCT inhibitor, not only inhibits lactic acid efflux in glycolytic gliomas but also disrupts redox hemostasis and enhances radiosensitivity. AZD3965, an MCT1 inhibitor, is currently being tested in phase I clinical trial in solid tumors. ### 11.7.2 Targeting Lipid Metabolism The first fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor, TVB-2640, is in clinical trials for cancer. Markers such as cell type, oncogene mutations, expression/activity of lipid synthesis enzymes, and metabolic profiles can be used to predict cancer cell sensitivity to lipid synthesis inhibition. The fact that lipoprotein supplementation can override DNLS inhibition emphasizes the importance of nutrient availability and, again, the role of exogenous lipid uptake. The availability of glucose for glucose-dependent lipogenesis is also important for cancer cell sensitivity to ACLY inhibitors. Low-glucose environments result in cancer cells that are less susceptible to ACLY inhibition because cancer cells can use acetate instead of citrate to produce acetyl-CoA for DNLS. ### 11.7.3 Combination Strategies **Metabolic Inhibitor Combinations** Elgogary et al. present another case of spatial metabolic heterogeneity. Pancreatic tumors were targeted by bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), a glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibitor, which was encapsulated in a nanoparticle to enhance drug delivery. The drug decreased tumor sizes, but metabolomics analysis revealed that surviving tumors relied on glycolysis and glycogen synthesis instead. Thus, further combination therapy of BPTES and metformin, a drug frequently used to treat diabetes by blocking glucose synthesis, further reduced tumor size. **Targeting CAF-Cancer Interactions** Metabolic cross talk between CAFs and cancer can be a metabolic target for cancer therapy. The reverse Warburg effects can be targeted via disruption of the \"lactate shuttle\" by MCT1/MCT 4 inhibitors. Metformin can be used to inhibit glycolysis and block the function of CAFs, which promote cancer cell growth. Blocking the glutamine uptake of cancer cells from CAFs is a strategy in targeting glutaminolysis. ### 11.7.4 Challenges in Metabolic Targeting **Drug Resistance and Metabolism** The response to cytotoxic drugs often depends on the metabolic state of",

Similar results are shown in Figure 1, where the oxygen consumption rates (OCRs; mitochondrial respiration) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR; glycolysis) of a range of cancer cell lines are compared under high (25\u2005mM) and low (1\u2005mM) glucose conditions. Under high glucose (25\u2005mM) conditions, cancer cell lines either show the Warburg effect (low OCR and high ECAR), high rates of OCR and low ECAR or something in between high/moderate OCR with high/moderate ECAR.

Metabolic profiling using the labeled substrate has shown that the carbon atoms of glucose predominantly occur in lactate, fatty acids, and nucleic acid-associated ribose, reflecting both the high proliferation rate and the reduction of oxidative phosphorylation in aggressive cancer cells. Decreased energy metabolism and glucose uptake in the brain are observed in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).[65\u201368] Despite the variety, experimental and clinical research has demonstrated that metabolic abnormalities are prevalent in a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders.[69] Since tumors have many ancestries and genomic instability, cancer cells are similar genetically and phenotypically diverse.[70] Tumors, such as glioblastoma, ingest more glucose and rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism.",

Even though it is commonly assumed that Warburg effect is a consequence of carcinogenesis, yet another hypothesis could be brought up that the cellular switch to aerobic glycolysis may represent the very point in time when a normal cell becomes cancerous. Unlike Warburg's initial hypothesis that cancer cells metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis due to impaired mitochondrial function a new hypothesis was presented that the normal cell becomes cancerous at the point when it switches its glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. However, even the acceptance of the aerobic glycolysis being a more adequate glucose metabolism pathway for cancer cells, the question of a hen or an egg remains: is the Warburg effect just a consequence, or could it be the very cause of carcinogenesis (Figure 4)?",

These proposals together conclude that the Warburg Effect supports a metabolic environment that allows for the rapid biosynthesis to support growth and proliferation. It is likely that the Warburg Effect provides an overall benefit that supports a tumor microenvironment conducive to cancer cell proliferation. We and others have proposed that the Warburg Effect confers direct signaling functions to tumor cells [18, 39, 47-49]. Extensive research on the Warburg Effect and its functions in cancer cells have advanced our understanding of its causes and requirements for tumor cell proliferation [29, 52]. * Both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism are essential for cell proliferation in both past and present conceptions of the Warburg Effect.

        "snippet": "treat diabetes by blocking glucose synthesis, further reduced tumor size. **Targeting CAF-Cancer Interactions** Metabolic cross talk between CAFs and cancer can be a metabolic target for cancer therapy. The reverse Warburg effects can be targeted via disruption of the \"lactate shuttle\" by MCT1/MCT 4 inhibitors. Metformin can be used to inhibit glycolysis and block the function of CAFs, which promote cancer cell growth. Blocking the glutamine uptake of cancer cells from CAFs is a strategy in targeting glutaminolysis. ### 11.7.4 Challenges in Metabolic Targeting **Drug Resistance and Metabolism** The response to cytotoxic drugs often depends on the metabolic state of the cancer cells, and these cells rewire the metabolism of anticancer drugs. Metabolic alterations can be influenced by various factors such as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and the tumor microenvironment. Downstream of survival signaling pathways, the Warburg effect, which refers to the increased rate of glycolysis in tumorigenic cells, can be observed even in conditions of normal oxygen levels. In c-Myc-driven HCC, glucose catabolism through glycolysis is elevated via the activation of pyruvate kinase. Inhibition of glycolysis and increase in oxidative phosphorylation can re-sensitize HCC cells to chemotherapeutics such as sorafenib, cisplatin, and isoliensinine. **Tumor Microenvironment Factors** Solid tumors are heterogeneous structures. The tumor microenvironment is composed of cancer and stromal cells embedded in extracellular matrix, sustained by aberrant vasculature. Tumor hypoperfusion, secondary to the hyperpermeability of the aberrant vasculature, along with low oxygen, depleted nutrition, low pH, and high interstitial pressure can cause chemoresistance. Compared to normal cells, cancer cells exhibit higher glucose metabolism rates and preferentially utilize glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, especially in hypoxic conditions (Warburg effect). This process ultimately generates lactic acid, leading to intracellular acidification. As a result, cancer cells may express relatively more proton pumps in order to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis, rendering the extracellular environment highly acidic. ## 11.8 Future Directions and Clinical Translation ### 11.8.1 Personalized Metabolic Therapy There is heterogeneity in glucose metabolism across tumor types as well as within the tumor microenvironment. Numerous therapies targeting glucose metabolism have been developed but have yet to show success in clinical trials. This highlights the need for better patient selection and understanding of metabolic heterogeneity. The tumor microenvironment influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to lipid synthesis inhibition. Understanding these contextual factors will be crucial for successful clinical translation of metabolic therapies. ### 11.8.2 Integration with Other Treatment Modalities Natural products can also increase the sensitivity of HCC cells to anticancer drugs by regulating cellular metabolism. Li and colleagues demonstrated that dauricine dose-dependently suppressed glucose glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation by downregulating the expression of hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2, consequently increasing the sensitivities of HCC to cisplatin, sorafenib, and isoliensinie. Experimental data show that natural products can reverse MDR via regulating drug efflux, drug metabolism, and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells. Despite a better understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance, and the experimental approaches that have been taken to overcome drug resistance over the decades, clinical utility of these approaches",

For example, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), an enzyme involved in the generation of lactate from glucose in Warburg effect-displaying cells, has also been found to be a suitable target for effective tumor reduction through small-molecule inhibition. ## 11.3 Mitochondrial Function in Cancer ### 11.3.1 Mitochondrial Structure and Function Mitochondria play a critical role in the generation of metabolic energy in eukaryotic cells. They are responsible for most of the useful energy derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates and fatty acids, which is converted to ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria are surrounded by a double-membrane system, consisting of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes separated by an intermembrane space. The inner membrane is highly specialized. Its lipid bilayer contains a high proportion of the \"double\" phospholipid cardiolipin, which has four fatty acids rather than two and may help to make the membrane especially impermeable to ions. ### 11.3.2 Mitochondria in Cancer Metabolism **Energy Production** Without mitochondria, present-day animal cells would be dependent on anaerobic glycolysis for all of their ATP. When glucose is converted to pyruvate by glycolysis, only a very small fraction of the total free energy potentially available from the glucose is released. In mitochondria, the metabolism of sugars is completed: the pyruvate is imported into the mitochondrion and oxidized by O2 to CO2 and H2O. This allows 15 times more ATP to be made than that produced by glycolysis alone. Mitochondria occupy a substantial portion of the cytoplasmic volume of eucaryotic cells, and they have been essential for the evolution of complex animals. Time-lapse microcinematography of living cells, however, shows that mitochondria are remarkably mobile and plastic organelles, constantly changing their shape and even fusing with one another and then separating again. **Metabolic Integration** The matrix enzymes include those that metabolize pyruvate and fatty acids to produce acetyl CoA and those that oxidize acetyl CoA in the citric acid cycle. The principal end-products of this oxidation are CO2, which is released from the cell as waste, and NADH, which is the main source of electrons for transport along the respiratory chain\u2014the name given to the electron-transport chain in mitochondria. Mitochondria can use both pyruvate and fatty acids as fuel. Pyruvate comes from glucose and other sugars, whereas fatty acids come from fats. Both of these fuel molecules are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane and then converted to the crucial metabolic intermediate acetyl CoA by enzymes located in the mitochondrial matrix. ### 11.3.3 Mitochondrial Protein Import and Assembly Most mitochondrial proteins are translated on free cytosolic ribosomes and imported into the organelle by specific targeting signals. The assembly of mitochondria thus involves proteins encoded by their own genomes and translated within the organelle, as well as proteins encoded by the nuclear genome and imported from the cytosol. The nucleus contains the genes that encode most of the mitochondrial proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation and all",

        "snippet": "in the Warburg effect, the flux of glucose to lactate is up to 100 times faster than through the TCA cycle resulting in similar amounts of ATP production over the same time. Even when oxidative phosphorylation is actively continuing, aerobic glycolysis will see much higher glucose flux. **Anabolic Requirements** To further understand a cancer cell's dependence on aerobic glycolysis, it is necessary to revisit one of the hallmarks of cancer\u2014rapid proliferation supported by strong anabolism. Tumor cells need not only ATP but also anabolic metabolism to accumulate a large amount of biomass to sustain their growth. **Clinical Applications** PET is an exploitation of the high rate of glycolysis in cancer cells as it uses a radiolabeled glucose analog, [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG), which accumulates in tumor cells due to their rapid uptake of glucose. Another developing application of the Warburg effect is the use of gene expression profiles linked to glycolysis to determine prognosis. Tools in both lung adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer have shown that glycolytic phenotypes are generally associated with worse patient survival. ### 11.1.3 Metabolic Heterogeneity For a long time, it was believed that cancer cells' major metabolic footprint was the Warburg effect, which dictates that cancer cells undergo glycolysis to produce lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen, a process termed aerobic glycolysis. Although the Warburg effect is still relevant, it has recently become clear that the metabolic phenotypes of cancer cells are far more varied and intricate. In a recent study published by Le et al., the identification of genetic variability within the same tumor also revealed distinct metabolic profiles of each cell subpopulation within a given tumor. In addition to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) positive and/or cycling cells (Warburg effect-displaying cells), they found that the subpopulation that was HIF negative and non-cycling expressed a distinct set of genes with increased expression of mitochondrial genes as compared to other subpopulations. ## 11.2 Glucose Metabolism in Cancer ### 11.2.1 Glycolytic Pathway Regulation **Basic Glycolysis Pathway** Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway and an anaerobic energy source that has evolved in nearly all types of organisms. The process entails the oxidation of glucose molecules, the single most crucial organic fuel in plants, microbes, and animals. In glycolysis, 2 ATP molecules are consumed, producing 4 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvates per glucose molecule. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of the cell. It is a metabolic pathway that creates ATP without the use of oxygen but can occur in the presence of oxygen. In cells that use aerobic respiration as the primary energy source, the pyruvate formed from the pathway can be used in the citric acid cycle and go through oxidative phosphorylation to undergo oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. **Enhanced Glycolysis in Cancer** Tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis as opposed to normal cells. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressors drive the metabolic reprogramming underlying the Warburg effect and other changes in glucose metabolism. The amount of glucose available for the process regulates glycolysis,",
